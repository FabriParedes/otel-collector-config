This project demonstrates how to instrument an application using OpenTelemetry and route telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) through an OTLP-based collector pipeline, both locally and via Docker.

It was developed in two phases:

A-Level (Basic): Local OpenTelemetry SDK printing traces to the console.

E-Level (Advanced): Dockerized OpenTelemetry Collector receiving OTLP data and exporting logs locally.# otel-collector-config
